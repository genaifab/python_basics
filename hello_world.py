# The print() function displays text on the screen
print("Hello, World!")

# Key concepts for absolute beginners:
#
# 1. FUNCTIONS: print() is a built-in function that outputs text
#    - Functions perform specific tasks
#    - You "call" a function by writing its name followed by parentheses
#    - The parentheses contain "arguments" - data you give to the function
#
# 2. STRINGS: "Hello, World!" is a string (text data)
#    - Strings must be surrounded by quotes (single ' or double ")
#    - The quotes tell Python "this is text, not code"
#    - Without quotes, Python would think Hello and World are variable names
#
# 3. SYNTAX: Python is picky about spelling and punctuation
#    - print() must be lowercase
#    - Don't forget the parentheses and quotes
#    - Each instruction goes on its own line
#
# 4. EXECUTION: Python reads your code from top to bottom, line by line
#    - When you run this program, it will display: Hello, World!
#
# This simple program demonstrates the most fundamental programming concept:
# giving the computer precise instructions to perform a task
